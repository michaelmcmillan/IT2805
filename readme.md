#### Course description
The focus in this course is on the World Wide Web as a platform for interactive
applications, content publishing and social services. The development of web-based
applications requires knowledge about the underlying technology and the formats
and standards the web is based upon.

In this course you will learn about the HTTP
communication protocol, the markup languages HTML, XHTML and XML, the CSS and XSLT
standards for formatting and transforming web content, event-based programming
on the client-side, interactive graphics and multimedia content on the web. The
course will also give an introduction in web search and indexing as well as
information management aspects such as digital rights and standards for describing
web content.
